# bookbot

BookBot is a personal project that analyzes text files (e.g., books) and produces useful reading statistics. It parses plain text, counts characters and words, ranks word frequencies, and generates a tidy report you can view in the terminal or save to a file.

**Features**
- Read plain-text files from a local path
- Count total words and characters (including per-letter counts aâ€“z)
- Compute word frequency rankings
- Normalize text (case-folding, punctuation stripping)
- Output a clean, human-readable report
- Simple CLI interface

To run it, download repository and run the main.py file from the terminal as: python3 main.py path_to_book
